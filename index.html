				Reports of Derelict Vehicles on the Rise in Jamaica Despite Years of Promises to Combat the Issue
			</h1>
		
		<p class="subhead">Despite constant claims from elected officials, abandoned vehicles still litter the streets of Jamaica, Queens at steadily increasing rates. So far, no solutions have been successfully implemented even amidst safety concerns from residents.</p>

			<p class="intro">In Jamaica, Queens NY, derelict vehicles continue to be a big issue. Abandoned vehicles were the 3rd most popular 311 service request this year, maintaining its same position from the previous year. In the month of September alone, there was 277 calls to 311 pertaining to this issue, with another 375 pertaining to cars with license plates.
			</p>
			<p>
				This has been an ongoing problem for years, with few solutions being presented. The DSNY (Department of Sanitation) has a derelict vehicle unit that will tag abandoned cars if they do not have plates. However, if there are plates it is up to the local precinct to tag the vehicle.
			</p>
            <p>
                In addition to being unpleasant to look at, there have been reports of residents being fined for parking across the street from their homes due to derelict vehicles blocking the space in front of their property. Other complaints include the cars being filled with junk that could pose a potential danger to children playing outside.</p>
            <p>
                In August, Mayor Eric Adams announced a composting project throughout Queens aimed in particular at aiding the Jamaica area, though Manhattan has already had one for several years. It is yet to be seen if this project will expand to aid in the disposal of vehicles.</p>
